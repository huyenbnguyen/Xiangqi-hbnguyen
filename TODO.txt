 * Check to see whether the move is valid.
     * ASSUMPTION: coordinates are already standardized.
     * The move is invalid when:
     * 1. There's a piece from source to destination that blocks it: X
     * 2. [General Only] The General put itself in check
     * 3. There's no way to go from source to destination given the rules of the piece: X
     * 4. The color of the piece doesn't match with turn (i.e. the player tries to move a piece not on their side): X
     * 6. Coordinates are valid: X
     
     
     
• A player may not move the General to a position where the General is in
check. If this is done, the implementation will return an INVALD move result: DONE
• A player may not expose the General to check. That is if a player tries to make
a move that would leave the General in check, the implementation will return
an INVALID result: DONE
• If a move puts a player in checkmate, the game should return a WIN for the
player who put the opponent in checkmate and the game is over.
• If a General is in check (not checkmate), the player must make a move that
removes the check either by moving the General to safety or blocking the
check through capture of interposing a piece between the attacker and the
General. Any other attemped move will result in the implementation
returning INVALID.
